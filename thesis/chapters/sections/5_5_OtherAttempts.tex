\section{Other attempts}
\label{sec:ch5sec6}

Among the author's first trials to address the HTR problem consisted of geometric approaches. Due to concerns of performance, one preprocessing idea was to use a vectorization algorithm like Potrace \cite{Potrace} to extract the calligraphy contour. The control points obtained so would then be evaluated by a RNN model of manageable small size in the hope of cutting off training time costs. This method brings the problem closer to an online HTR system. This gave birth to a segmentation idea that implies trying to fit B{\'e}zier curves over the handwritten text. However, as this project progresses along with the author's to-be-improved knowledge in the field of machine learning and accustomance with the visions and practices in the HTR matter, these ideas have been gradually abandoned in favor of a safer and less time consuming approaches.
