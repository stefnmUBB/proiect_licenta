\par The concept of artificial intelligence is almost as old as modern computing. Initially started as a product of fantasy by science-fiction authors like Isaac Asimov, the advancement of technology revealed the true potential of computing machines. Alan Turing, the one who in 1940's broke the German Enigma code during World War II, has formulated the famous Turing test, meant to define machine intelligence based on the incapacity of a human actor to distinguish whether an entity is a human or a robot while interacting with it. Eventually, more formal definitions of machine learning arose by the work of John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, Herbert Simon and others. AI research has been flourished until the 1970's when it was met with the computing power limitations of that time. It was not until the 1980's when governments and agencies restarted to fund AI projects, but significant progress started to cristalize once the hardware became more capable, improved algorithms came to light and 
researchers performed a shift of mindset from expert systems, rules in decision making, to considering approaches based on probabilities which opened up the way to neural networks and what we know today as deep learning \cite{BriefHistoryOfAI}.
